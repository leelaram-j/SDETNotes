Dockers:

a software that is installed on an OS:

it helps us to create containers(Virtual machine concept), with less resources.

this is ideally used in automation to run selenium grid concept

grid concept:

suppose 2 have 100 test cases and each test case takes a min to execute. in this case it will take 100 mins to execute all the cases

but if we have 3 VM's then it would take only 33 mins to run all test cases as the cases are run parallely.

equally split between them all


Docker concept:

one single os

container a:
os+chrome

container b:
os+firefox

docker is a containerization platform, you can build your application, package them alone with their dependencies into a container and then these containers can be easlily shipped to run other applocations.

What is a container and image?

An image is a light weight standalone executable piece of software that includes evrything needed to run an application code,runtime,system tools,system settings and libraries.

container is the runtime instance of the image

Image components:

Selenium jars
java
Chrome

Docker file:
instructions to build a docker image.

Difference between Containers and Virtual Machines?

Virtualization-technique of installing guest os on host os

Containerzation is however more efficient because there is no guest os, reosurce share and utlizes a host's OS. And it will share the relevant libraries and resources 
as when needed unlike virtual machines. THis will be more efficient. Light weight and faster.

Containers are smalled thant eh virtaul machines and enable faster startup with better performance, less isolation nd greater compatibility due to sharing of the host's
kernel.

Docker hub--

it is like a repository collection of images, u can download and deploy the same in your container.

https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium

docker --version

docker ps--if any continers running...


docker pull selenium/standalone-chrome:latest

if we need to mention the  version we need to give : after chrome


docker images ---> this will list the number of images that are availble in the docker locally

docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome:latest

-d ---> this is to deploy the image
-p ---> port number, we must direct our tests to run on this port.
/dev/shm:/dev/shm --> this is done so that chrome doesnt crashes and it uses the RAM memory
selenium/standalone-chrome:latest -->image name and version

docker stop container_id ---> this will stop the container.


docker run -d -p 4445:4445 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-firefox:latest
starting anothe containere in another port

Ansible

simple IT automation engine that automates all the commands that you can provide on a terminal.

YAML file -> Ansible playbooks that allows you to describe your autoamtion jobs in plain english

it works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs called ansible modules to them.

Ansible then executes these modules over ssh and removes them once finished.

it is used when we need to instal a bunch of softwares on several computers...it is a devops tool.


ansible management node: main server from where ansible instructions are sent.

host inventory: this will contain the list of all ip address..

playbook: this will contian the instructions that are needed to be run on other servers. 

you need to give sudo access to ec2-user in order to perform actions

echo "ec2-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers



ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
